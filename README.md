### Creational Design Patterns

<li> <b> Singleton </b> <br>

  The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts a class to have only one instance of itself,<br> 
  
  while providing a single point of access to that instance for all other objects in the system. This is useful<br> 
  
  when only one instance of a class is needed to control the action throughout the execution of the program, <br>
  
  such as managing database connections or logging data.<br>
